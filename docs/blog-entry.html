<p>AMC is a commercial product available as part of Oracle Java Standard Edition (SE) Advanced and Oracle Java SE Suite. AMC helps you manage the use of Java versions and Java applications in your enterprise.</p>

<p>Key benefits of using AMC 2.10 include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Usage Tracking:</strong> The Advanced Management Console collects information about which Java applications are launched by which Java versions, creating an application compatibility inventory. Usage Tracking can be configured automatically through the Windows Agent, or by using the configuration properties on other platforms. </li>
	<li><strong>Taking Action:</strong> The Deployment Rule Set capabilities enable different Applet and Web Start applications to use different versions of Java installed on clients. This benefits organizations that must use older versions of Java or need many different Java versions for different reasons.</li>
	<li><strong>MSI Customizations:</strong> System Administrators can use the Java Install Customizer tool to repackage MSIs, controlling the way that Java is installed on managed systems.</li>
</ul>
