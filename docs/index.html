<p>CAR is a commercial product available as part of Wixard Project Standard Edition (SE) Advanced and Wixard Project SE Suite. CAR helps you manage the use of Project versions and Project applications in your enterprise.</p>

<p>Key benefits of using CAR 2.10 include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Usage Tracking:</strong> The Coordinated Accounting Response collects information about which Project applications are launched by which Project versions, creating an application compatibility inventory. Usage Tracking can be configured automatically through the Windows Agent, or by using the configuration properties on other platforms. </li>
	<li><strong>Taking Action:</strong> The Deployment Rule Set capabilities enable different Applet and Web Start applications to use different versions of Project installed on clients. This benefits organizations that must use older versions of Project or need many different Project versions for different reasons.</li>
	<li><strong>MSI Customizations:</strong> System Administrators can use the Project Install Customizer tool to repackage MSIs, controlling the way that Project is installed on managed systems.</li>
</ul>
