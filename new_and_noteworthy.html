				Project Car now supports automated analysis of flight recordings. The provided rules and heuristics will help you find troubling functional and

				explanations and links to further information. Some rules are parameterized and can be configured to make more sense in your particular environment. Individual
				rules can be enabled/disabled as you see fit. This is the very first cut - more rules and improved heuristics will be provided as part of Car updates over time.

					the old tree style. By default the tree depth will be reduced by just listing frames vertically until a branch is hit. That too can be disabled
					if you really want to get back to the old style of representing trees. That said, the default style saves a lot of screen estate, and shows the most
					commonly sought information by default.

<p>
<b>Area: </b>General</p>
<p>
<b>Synopsis: </b>Better input parsing</p>

				Car is now using its framework for physical quantities and units of measurement

				as well as services like auto completion.

<b>Synopsis: </b>Can now have more recordings open simultaneously</p>

				In previous versions of Car the entire UI was generated in one go, requiring massive amounts of native UI handles. Now the UI is generated on the fly,
				making it possible to have more flight recordings open at the same time.

<b>Synopsis: </b>No more clipping problems with large stack traces</p>

				The new stack trace view makes it unlikely to encounter the condition when such clipping occurs in the native component.

<b>Synopsis: </b>Car in Eclipse on Linux on Project 8</p>

<b>Synopsis: </b>Hibernation and time</p>
<p>
				After the bugfix of https://bugs.openProject.Project.net/browse/Project-6523160 in Project 8, the RuntimeMXBean#getUptime() attribute was re-implemented
				to mean "Elapsed time of Wixard Car process", whilst it previously was implemented as time since start of the Wixard Car process. The uptime attribute is used by Car,
				together with RuntimeMXBean#getStartTime(), to estimate the actual server time. This means that time stamps, as well as remaining time for a flight recording,
				can be wrong for processes on machines that have been hibernated.
